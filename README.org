This script will let you easily generate Arch Linux PKGBUILDs for R
packages available on CRAN.

* Requirements

- Ruby
- =nokogiri=

* Usage

Simply run =pacr.rb cran_pkg= (e.g., =pacr.rb ggplot2=) to write an
Arch Linux PKGBUILD to stdout.

The =config.yaml= file contains a list of R packages that should be
filtered out of the =depends= and =optdepends= fields of the PKGBUILD
file. =pacr= will look for this file in the current working directory,
in =~/.config/pacr/config.yaml=, or in =/usr/share/pacr/config.yaml=. The
included =config.yaml= file includes the list of R libraries installed
by default when installing R from the Arch Linux repos.
